# The Art of Clean Code

Writing clean code is an art that every developer should master. Clean code is not just about making your code workâ€”it's about making it readable, maintainable, and elegant.

## What is Clean Code?

Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. It follows consistent naming conventions, has clear structure, and is well-documented.

### Key Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing well
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simplicity is key

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some practical examples of how to write cleaner code...

# Mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox

CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout systems that have revolutionized how we build responsive web designs. In this guide, we'll explore both in depth.

## Understanding Flexbox

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts. It excels at distributing space and aligning items in a container.

## CSS Grid for Two-Dimensional Layouts

CSS Grid is ideal when you need to control both rows and columns simultaneously.

### When to Use Each

- Use Flexbox for: Navigation bars, card layouts, centering content
- Use Grid for: Page layouts, image galleries, complex responsive designs
